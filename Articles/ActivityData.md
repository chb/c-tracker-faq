Activity Data
=============

If you give the C3-PRO app your permission, it can use information about your physical activity that is recorded on your iPhone.
This is called “_passive_” tracking because this happens automatically and you do not need to enter any information.

The app interprets data about how many steps you have taken when walking or running, and also provides information on how long you have been walking, running, working out or even been sedentary or asleep.

To help make this information as useful as possible, you should carry the iPhone with you as much as possible, for instance in your pocket or clipped on your waist belt.

Dashboard
---------

The dashboard shows you the amount of time, during the past 7 days, that you've spent with different kinds of activities.
You can also see how many steps you've taken and flights of stairs you've climbed on an average day.
