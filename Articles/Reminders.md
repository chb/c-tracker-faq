Reminders
=========

The C3-PRO app will set occasional reminders (about every 4 months) to use the app to complete study tasks.
You can choose not to have the app provide reminders.

Time of Day
-----------

In the app's **You** » **Reminders** section you will find the option to change the time of day the app will remind you about tasks.
You can change the time to suit you better.

Additionally, whenever a reminder pops up, you have the option to be reminded again either **one hour** or **one day** later.

Disable Reminders
-----------------

In the app's **You** » **Reminders** section you can also completely disable or re-enable reminders.
If you choose to disable reminders we would appreciate a note as to your motivation to do so.
This way we may improve the app to better suit everybody's needs.
