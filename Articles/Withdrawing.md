Withdrawing
===========

If you start the research study but later do not wish to participate, you can use the “_Leave Study_” link in the Profile section of the app.
You may choose to leave the study at any time, but this action cannot be undone.

The study investigators may also withdraw you from the study without your consent at any time for any reason, including if the study is cancelled.
