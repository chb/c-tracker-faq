Privacy
=======

We will ask you about your health, your activities, your medications, and ways in which hepatitis&nbsp;C has impacted you.
This information will be reported anonymously, which means that the researchers doing the study won’t know who you are.


Result Publication
------------------

The results of this research may be published, including in research journals, and presented at research conferences so that others can learn about the results of this study.
The results of the study will not be recorded in a way that identifies individual users.


Risks
-----

There are some risks that could happen by taking part in this study.
One risk is a loss of privacy, which means that someone else would be able to see the information you report using the app, or learns that you have hepatitis&nbsp;C because you have the app on your iPhone.

For security, C3-PRO requires that your iPhone be protected either by a passcode or the Apple Touch ID fingerprint sensor.
This helps to prevent others from entering and using the app.
Whenever app data is transferred from your iPhone back to the C3-PRO researchers, it will be encrypted so that it would be very difficult for anyone else to see your data.

If required by law, your study information may be disclosed to United States Department of Health and Human Services agencies, the Office for Human Research Protection, and other agencies as required by law.
Also, the Institutional Review Board at Boston Children’s Hospital, which monitors the safety and conduct of human research, can look at the study information, but will not know who you are.
